function varargout = scission_analysis(varargin)
% SCISSION_ANALYSIS M-file for scission_analysis.fig
%      SCISSION_ANALYSIS, by itself, creates a new SCISSION_ANALYSIS or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SCISSION_ANALYSIS returns the handle to a new SCISSION_ANALYSIS or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SCISSION_ANALYSIS('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SCISSION_ANALYSIS.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SCISSION_ANALYSIS('Property','Value',...) creates a new SCISSION_ANALYSIS or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before scission_analysis_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to scission_analysis_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
